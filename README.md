# Calculator
This is basic calculator made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features
- Responsive button layout
- Basic arithmetic operations: '+', '-','*','/'
- Clear ('C') and equals ('=') buttons
- Functional display for input and results

## How It Works
- Each button calls a JavaScript function:
- addValue(val) → Adds the clicked value to the display
- clearDisplay() → Clears the display  
- calculate() → Evaluates the expression in the display
